## File Structure

```
|-- CMakeModule         Some useful cmake macros.
|-- dependencies        The dependencies that the project needs.
|   |-- cmake           Dependencies that use CmakeList to download.
|   |-- online          The install dir of compiled dependencies in tarballs
|   |-- pre_installed   Some header-only libs stored in git repo. No downloading needed.
|   `-- tarballs        The archieves of dependencies is downloaded into this foleder.
|-- generated           The generated code of protobuf files.
|   |-- protos
|   `-- test
|-- protos              The protobuf files.
|-- src                 Source code dir.
|   |-- SlurmCtlXd      
|   |-- SlurmXd
|   `-- Utilities       Some function needed both by SlurmCtlXd and SlurmXd.
`-- test                Test codes.
    |-- Misc            Some codes for idea proving purpose and not related to this project.
    |-- protos          Test codes for gRPC functions.
    |-- SharedTestImpl  Functions that all test codes need.
    |-- SlurmCtlXd      Test codes for SlurmCtlXd.
    |-- SlurmXd         Test codes for SlurmXd.
    `-- Utilities       Test codes for Utilities.

## Development Plan

### All

- [ ] Use the data structure generated by protobuf instead of an duplicated C++ version.
- [ ] LibEvent->LibUv
- [ ] LibEvent

- [ ] Fix bugs in the scheduling algorithm.
- [ ] Persistence of task queues

### SlurmXd

- [ ] Add GPU Isolation in cgroup.

### SBatchX

- [ ] -o arg, -e arg
- [ ] --node arg, --task-per-node arg
- [ ] -p arg
- [ ] -J arg
- [ ] --time arg
